 Fish Classification with Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project implements a classification model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to categorize different species of fish based on various features such as weight, length, and height. The goal is to provide an efficient and accurate approach to classifying fish using a machine learning model built in Python.

 Overview
In this project, we employ an ANN model to classify fish species. The neural network takes several input features, processes them through multiple layers, and outputs the predicted fish species.

The project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing techniques (scaling, encoding).
- Training and evaluation of an ANN model using the Keras library.
- Visualization of training progress and model performance metrics.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various physical characteristics of fish species such as:
- Weight
- Length (multiple measures)
- Height
- Width

Each entry in the dataset is labeled with the fish species it belongs to. The dataset is preprocessed to remove missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables.

Model Architecture
The ANN is structured as follows:
- **Input Layer**: Accepts multiple features related to fish characteristics.
- **Hidden Layers**: Consist of dense layers with ReLU activation functions.
- **Output Layer**: Uses softmax activation to predict the fish species (multi-class classification).

The model is compiled using categorical cross-entropy as the loss function and Adam optimizer for efficient training.

 Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (or `keras`)

You can install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ecekaradasli/fishclassificationwithANN.git
    ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook (`fish-classification-with-ann.ipynb`).
3. Run all the cells to train and evaluate the ANN model on the fish dataset.

 Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately [insert accuracy] on the test data. The performance can be improved by tuning hyperparameters, experimenting with different architectures, or using more advanced techniques such as regularization.

Training progress and model accuracy are visualized in the notebook.
